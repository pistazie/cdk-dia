# Decoration Example

This example AWS-CDK project shows how one can use the `CdkDia.decorate` method in order to customize a diagram.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then run the following to synthesize the CDK stack and automatically generate the diagram:

```bash
npm run synth
```

## Local development

To work on `cdk-dia` and this project locally, use `npm run link` script.
